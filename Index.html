    <h1>Myself
        <P>My name is Francis Dey. I am an Msc Student of KNUST IDL. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favorite courses are Cyber Law etc.
            I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.</P><img src="./KODZO.jpg" alt="the image did not load">
